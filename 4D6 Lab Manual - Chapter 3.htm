Program Development</H3>
<P>The traditional way of developing a program written in a high level language 
such as BASIC, Fortran, C or Pascal, is to begin with an <B>editor</B> in order 
to create a text file. This file is converted by a <B>source code compiler</B> 
to produce <B>object code</B>. Finally, the object code is linked, loaded and 
then executed. In most cases, the compiler first converts the source code to an 
assembly language file and then an <B>assembler</B> converts the assembly code 
into object code. This stage is usually hidden from the programmer. The entire 
process can be view graphically as shown.</P>

border=0></P>
<P><BR>Most programmers today use an <B>integrated develoment environment</B> 
(IDE) where the entire process of editing, compiling and debugging is 
drammatically less painful. One only has to type in the lines of code and then 
click on the RUN button. In any case, the process still remains the same even if 
it may be done automatically for you.</P>
<P>There are two ways of creating and assembling HC11 programs. The first method 
is to use an IDE software package. This IDE will allow you to edit, assemble and 
download the HC11 programs from one utility. A simulator and debugger is in 
development, so for now you will have to create your own techniques for 
debugging programs. Note that this IDE uses the same assembler and loader that 
are described below. </P>
<P>
<TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=10 width="100%" bgColor=#ccffcc border=1>
  <TBODY>
  <TR>
    <TD width="100%">A Windows IDE package is available which will assist you 
      in editing and assemblying your HC11 programs. A simulator and debugger 
      will be added at a later date. The IDE expects the source file to have an 
      extension of .ASM, though this is optional. To run the IDE, go to the 
      folder named <B><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica">XASM</FONT></B> and open the 
      file named <B><FONT 
  face="Arial, Helvetica">winide32.exe</FONT></B>.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P>
<P>If an IDE is not available, you have to resort to the traditional way of 
first editing the source file using an editor such as Notepad, WordPad or any 
text editor. The assembler is then invoked in order to translate the source code 
into object code. 
<H3>Editor</H3>
<P>Any editor or word processor that produces a text file can be used to create 
the source file. For our purposes the <B>Notepad</B> accessory works fine. This 
program creates a text file and will, by default, assign a .TXT extension to the 
filename. Filenames must not exceed eight characters in length.</P>
<H3><A name=Assembler></A>Assembler</H3>
<P>The HC11 assembler is called a <B>cross-assembler</B>, meaning that it is 
written to run on a host computer (PC) which is different from the target 
machine (MCU). The assembler is a DOS program and therefore must be executed 
from a DOS window. The program name is <FONT 
face="Courier New, Courier">XASM11</FONT>. To execute, type the following:</P>
<P><FONT face="Courier New, Courier">XASM11 filename.txt</FONT></P>
<P>where <FONT face="Courier New, Courier">filename.txt</FONT> is the name of 
your text file you wish to assemble. Errors encountered by the assembler will be 
displayed on the screen. At the same time, a listing file called <FONT 
face="Courier New, Courier">filename.LST</FONT> will be saved to disk. You can 
open and view this file in order to observe the memory addresses and machine 
code generated by the assembler.</P>
<H3>Loader</H3>
<P>After you are satisfied that there are no syntax or other assembler errors, 
you may then proceed to download the object code to your target MCU. To 
accomplish this, assemble your file once again, only this time use the /L switch 
in the command line to invoke the loading process.</P>
<P><FONT face="Courier New, Courier">XASM11 filename.txt</FONT> /L</P>
<P>You must always use the /L switch at the start of every programming session 
or if you change to a different source file. After the first usage of the /L 
switch, you can substantially speedup the downloading process by using the 
update switch /U instead. In this case, only program bytes which have changed 
will be programmed into the EEPROM of the target MCU. The command template to 
use the update feature is:</P>
<P><FONT face="Courier New, Courier">XASM11 filename.txt</FONT> /U</P>
<P>

  <TR>
    <TD width="100%"><B>Tip:</B> Pressing <B>F3</B> will recall the last 
      command line entered.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><BR>After the machine code has 
been transferred and written to the MCU's EEPROM, the MCU will be reset and 
normal execution will begin. At anytime you may manually reset the MCU by 
pressing the RESET button on the MCU developmental board.</P>
<P>
<H3>How the download procedure works</H3>
<P>XASM11 assembles the source code to produce the listing and object code. It 
then begins the downloading process by placing the HC11 MCU into a bootstrap 
mode. A special bootstrap program on the MCU located at $BF40 is executed. This 
program accepts sequential bytes from the serial input at 1200 baud and loads 
them into SRAM starting at address $0000. The XASM11 loader takes advantage of 
this process and transfers a binary loader program. After 256 bytes have been 
transferred, the MCU starts executing from address $0000. At this point, the 
binary loader takes over and programs the EEPROM with the information sent by 
the cross-assembler.</P>
<P>
<H3>Debugging Tips</H3>
<P>Without the aid of fancy debugging tools, it becomes quite a challenge to 
debug a program, especially one that runs wayward. Here are some tips for 
debugging your program.</P>
<OL>
  <LI>In the worst case, the program hangs at who knows where. A simple 
  technique for monitoring the progress of code execution is to insert code that 
  outputs a pulse to an output pin as in <A 
  href="http://www.physics.mcmaster.ca/phy4d6/Lab/source/ex1.txt">Example 1</A>. 
  You can even track which part of the code is being executed by outputting one, 
  two, three pulses, etc., at different parts of the program and watching the 
  signal on the oscilloscope. 
  <LI>If your application uses a display then you can output test messages and 
  data to the display. 
  <LI>You can also output test messages and information via the serial interface 
  and monitor the messages on a dumb terminal or a PC running a terminal 
  emulator such as <FONT face="Courier New, Courier">Hypertrm</FONT>. 
  <LI>The ultimate solution is to write a proper debugger that communicates with 
  a dumb terminal when ever a non-maskable interrupt is requested. With such a 
  program you can examine the contents of any register or memory address. 
  <P></P></LI></OL>
<H3>Programming Tips</H3>
<OL>
  <LI>If you cannot get your program to work, try reloading all bytes by using 
  the /L switch. 
  <LI>Also make sure that the name of the source file is no longer that 8 
  characters and that you are assemblying the file with the correct name. 
  <LI>Make sure that you always save the current version of the source file 
  before assemblying. 
  <LI>If you are using the X or Y index register to hold the base address of the 
  block of I/O registers, make sure that you initialize the register when an 
  interrupt service routine is called. 
  <LI>You cannot program the EEPROM with code residing in the EEPROM. One 
  solution is to store the EEPROM programming instructions in SRAM and execute 
  the code from there. 
  <LI>Place your debugged subroutines at low EEPROM addresses and put your new 
  code and main program at the end of the code. By doing this, code that has 
  been debugged and not likely to change will not get moved around in memory. 
  This will speedup the downloading process. </LI></OL>

Hardware Notes</H3>
<H4>MC68HC811 Prototyping Board</H4>
<P><IMG height=438 src="4D6 Lab Manual - Chapter 3_files/HC11proto.jpg" 
width=463 align=bottom border=0></P>
<P>The HC11 experimental board provides RS-232 serial access to the 
microprocessor, a 16-character x 2-line liquid crystal display and an optional 4 
x 4 (16-button) keypad. A schematic of this system is shown below.</P>
<H4>LCD Unit</H4>
<P>Software for controlling the LCD Unit has been written for you. Basically, 
the LCD is interfaced in the 4-bit mode utilizing PD5-PD2 input/output lines. 
Three output lines, PB2-PB0, are use to control the data interface with the LCD. 
PB0 is used to generate the register select (RS) signal, PB1 is the read/write 
(R/W) signal, and PB2 generates the clock signal (E).</P>
<H4>Keypad</H4>
<P>The optional keypad, or any other set of keys or push-buttons, are arranged 
in a 4x4 matrix. That is, there can be a maximum of sixteen buttons arranged in 
four rows by four columns. The keypad interface consists of four input/output 
lines PD5-PD2 which are also shared with the LCD interface. When used for keypad 
operation these lines are programmed for output and a high level must be 
generated on one of four lines (let's assume columns) in sequential order. The 
activated button can be determined by examining the 4-bit code read back from 
the four rows using PA3-PA0 input lines, in conjunction with the scan signal 
that was send out.</P>
<P>Any key-scanning software must be able to detect key-down and key-up 
occurances versus continuously pressed keys. It must also guard against switch 
contact bounce.</P>
<P><BR>The following signals are utilized on the HC11 developmental board.</P>
<OL>
  <P>PA0 - PA3, used to read the 4 x 4 keypad.</P>
  <P>PB0 -PB2, used to send control signals to the LCD</P>
  <P>PD0 - PD1, used for the serial interface</P>
  <P>PD2 - PD5, used to interface with the LCD and keypad</P></OL>
<P>Unused analog inputs and digital input/output lines are available for you to 
use.</P>
<P>
<H4>Differences between MC68HC11A8 and MC68HC811E2</H4>
<P>The Motorola MC68HC11A8 Technical Summary also applies to the MC68HC811E2 
with the following exceptions.</P>
<P>The MC68HC811E2 contains 2K bytes of EEPROM starting at address $F800.</P>
<P>Port A pin 3 (PA3) serves multiple functions. After reset, data direction bit 
3 (DDRA3), in the PACTL register is cleared to zero configuring PA3 as an input. 
PA3 can then be used as an input capture 4 (IC4), by setting I4/O5 (bit 2) to 
one in the PACTL register. The I4/O5 bit is configured to OC5 (cleared to zero) 
on reset. If DDRA3 is configured as an output and IC4 is enabled, writes to PA3 
causes edges on PA3 to result in input captures. The TOC5 Output Compare 5 
Register has been renamed TI4O5.</P>
<P>Timer Control Register 2 (TCTL2) has been expanded to accommodate input 
capture 4 (IC4) on PA3. Bit 7 of TCTL2 is EDG4B and bit 6 of TCTL2 is EDG4A.</P>

<A name=LCD></A>Using the LCD</H3>
<P>The HC11 develomental board comes equipped with a 2-line x 16-character 
Liquid Crystal Display (LCD). Software required to interface to the LCD is 
somewhat intricate and is therefore provided for your use. The hardware 
interface consists of a 4-bit data bus using PD5 - PD2, and three control 
signals RS, R/W and E controlled by PB0, PB1 and PB2 respectively. The LCD is 
controlled by writing data into one of two registers, the instruction register 
and the data register. Data written to the data register is assumed to be in 
ASCII and the corresponding character is displayed. Writing to the instruction 
register is used primarily for controlling the operation and display modes of 
the LCD.</P>
<P><A 
href="http://www.physics.mcmaster.ca/phy4d6/Lab/source/example2.txt">Example 
2</A> contains a working program broken into subroutines which will allow you to 
display characters on the LCD. A list of the subroutine names and their 
functions are shown below. Note that symbol names are case sensitive and must be 
typed as shown.

in the program. Use <FONT face="Courier New, Courier">LCDdr</FONT> to output a 
single ASCII character at the current cursor position on the display.</P>

<HR align=center>
<A name=ASCII></A><A 
href="http://www.physics.mcmaster.ca/phy4d6/Lab/ASCII.gif">ASCII TABLE</A></H3>
<P>The letters of the alphabet, digits and punctuation marks are collectively 
called alphanumeric characters. The <B>American Standard Code for Information 
Interchange</B> (ASCII, pronounced "<I>askee</I>") is a 7-bit code used to 
represent a standard set of alphanumeric characters. This code can represent 128 
characters of which only about 96 are required for alphanumeric characters. The 
remaining codes are used for special purposes such as line-feed, return, bell, 
etc., which are usually not visible or printable. These are called <B>control 
characters</B>. (Control characters are generated on the keyboard by holding the 
<B>Ctrl</B> key down and then pressing another key).</P>
<P>The smallest group of bits handled by most computers is 8 bits, that is, a 
byte. With one byte it is possible to represent 256 characters. Many personal 
computers use an extended ASCII, making use of the extra 128 codes to represent 
special graphic symbols originating with the IBM PC. In order to accommodate 
other languages, including Chinese and Japanese, a 16-bit representation called 
<B>Unicode</B> is rapidly becoming the new standard.</P>
<P>
<H3>
<HR align=center>
<A name=SCI></A>Serial Communications Interface</H3>
<P>The 68HC11 MCU comes with a full-duplex asynchronous Serial Communications 
Interface (SCI) which is used to communicate with other computers and devices 
using the RS-232 standard. For more information, see the section on <A 
href="http://www.physics.mcmaster.ca/phy4d6/Lab/Chapter8.htm#Serial">Serial 
Transmission</A> in Chapter 8.</P>
<P><A href="http://www.physics.mcmaster.ca/phy4d6/Lab/Source/example3.txt" 
target=code>Example 3</A> demonstrates how to setup the SCI, transmit and 
receive characters. Observe that the program is interrupt driven when receiving 
input characters. Characters received are placed into a buffer called <B><FONT 
face="Courier New, Courier">sbuf</FONT></B> until a CR character is received. 
When this occurs the bit named <B><FONT 
face="Courier New, Courier">SDA</FONT></B> (serial data available) in the 
variable named <B><FONT face="Courier New, Courier">flags</FONT></B> is set. The 
main program loops continuously always checking the <B><FONT 
face="Courier New, Courier">SDA</FONT></B> flag. When it finds <B><FONT 
face="Courier New, Courier">SDA</FONT></B> to be set, the subroutine named 
<B><FONT face="Courier New, Courier">input</FONT></B> is called where the 
<B><FONT face="Courier New, Courier">SDA</FONT></B> flag is cleared and the 
input buffer is processed.</P>
<P>Here is a list of applicable subroutines.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT face="Courier New, Courier">SCIini</FONT> - initialize the SCI for 
  9600 baud.</P>
  <P><FONT face="Courier New, Courier">putc</FONT> - outputs the 8-bit character

your program.</P>

<H3><A name=Interrupts></A>Interrupts</H3>
<P>Hardware interrupts are very important features of computers. Computer 
instructions are executed in a linear fashion. That is, instructions are fetched 
and executed one after another. While it is possible for the program to take 
different paths, only one task can be accomplished at any instance in time. 
<B>Multi-tasking</B>, the resemblance of performing many tasks at the same time, 
is in fact the CPU rapidly switching from one task to another. The CPU still 
performs one task at a time.</P>
<P><B>Interrupt</B> is the mechanism for pre-empting the attention of the CPU so 
that another task can be dealt with, just as you may be called away from your 
work temporarily when the phone rings. In a multi-tasking operating system, a 
periodic timer interrupt can be used in order to perform many different tasks in 
round-robin fashion. Interrupts are also used when a high priority event must be 
dealt with in a timely fashion.</P>
<P>In all cases of interrupts the flow of instruction execution is abruptly 
suspended. The new task is performed and then program execution resumes at the 
point where it was interrupted. For all of this to happen in a smooth manner the 
CPU (and software) must be capable of two things. Firstly, the CPU must record 
the address of the next instruction to be executed at the moment of 
interruption. This is the only way that the CPU would be able to resume proper 
program execution once the interrupting task was dealt with. Secondly, the 
context of all resources, i.e., accumulators, registers and flags, must be saved 
since these could be altered by the interrupting tasks.</P>
<P>On the HC11, this is automatically taken care of by the CPU when an interrupt 
occurs. The current program counter, accumulators and flags are stored on the <A 
href="http://www.physics.mcmaster.ca/phy4d6/Lab/chapter4.htm#Stacks" 
target=_blank>stack</A> before the interrupt is serviced.</P>
<P><IMG height=215 hspace=15 src="4D6 Lab Manual - Chapter 3_files/istack.gif" 
width=253 align=right vspace=10 border=0></P>
<P>The first pair of bytes to be pushed on to the stack is the current contents 
of the program counter, which would be the address of the next instruction to be 
executed. This is followed by the Y index register, X index register, A 
accumulator, B accumulator and Condition Code Register. The PC is then loaded 
with a new address which is the address of the interrupt service routine 
(ISR).</P>
<P>At the completion of the ISR, the RTI (Return from Interrupt) instruction is 
executed. This instruction pops all the registers off the stack in reverse order 
so that the context of the CPU is restored to the state that it was at the time 
of the interrupt.</P>
<P>
<H3>Interrupt Vectors</H3>
<P>The HC11 is designed to handle interrupts from 32 different sources. This is 
accomplished by reserving the last 64 bytes of program memory space from address 
$FFC0 to $FFFF called the <B>interrupt vector table</B>. For each interrupt, a 
pair of bytes in the table is used to store the address of the ISR. Here are the 
assignments for the 21 interrupt vectors that are used.</P>

<P>Note that the last vector in the Interrupt Vector Table is the RESET vector. 
In other words, the last two bytes of program space at location $FFFE-FFFF must 
contain the address of the start of the program. When the MCU is reset the 
starting address is fetched from the RESET vector location and is loaded into 
the PC.

<A name=Timer></A>Timer System</H3>
<P>The HC11 contains a 16-bit programmable timer which is useful for many 
applications involving timing, counting, frequency and period measurement and 
waveform generation. The 8 pins assigned to PORTA are given specific 
input/output functions shown in the table below. When not used specifically for 
timer functions these pins can also be used as general purpose input or output 
pins. Note that ports PA0, PA1 and PA2 are always inputs, PA4, PA5 and PA6 are 
always outputs and PA3 and PA7 can be inputs or outputs.</P>

border=0></P>
<P>PA7 is used as the Pulse Accumulator Input which can be used to increment an 
8-bit counter from an external source. PA6 - PA3 are Output Compare outputs 2 to 
5 while PA2 - PA0 are Input Capture inputs 1 to 3. Note that PA3 can be 
programmed to be either OC5 or IC4. A 1 written to bit-2 of PACTL will enable 
IC4 function instead of OC5.</P>
<P>PortA is available at connector P4 on the HC11 prototyping board. PA3-PA0 are 
also used to input data from the 4 x 4 keypad connection at P1.</P>
<H3>Programmable Timer</H3>
<P>Discussion of the programmable timer system is simplifed by the following 
block diagram. Since all the Output Compare functions are identical, only one 
will be discussed. Similarly, only one Input Capture function will be 
discussed.</P>

<P align=center><IMG height=61 src="4D6 Lab Manual - Chapter 3_files/timer.gif"

<P>The MCU is clocked by a quartz crystal oscillator at a frequency of 8MHz. 
This is divided by 4 to create the MCU E clock which determines the basic 
machine cycle time. The E clock is further divided by a programmable prescaler 
determined by the setting of two bits PR1 and PR0 of the Timer Interrupt Mask 
Register 2 (TMSK2). The output of the prescaler increments the free running 
16-bit counter TCNT. A timer overflow signal TOF is generated when the TCNT 
overflows.</P>

<H3>Output Compare</H3>
<P>The output compare feature is used to generate periodic waveforms or to 
create timer functions. The 16-bit timer/counter TCNT is allowed to increment 
continuously. An output compare register is chosen, for example, TOC2, and is 
preset to a given 16-bit value. When the content of TCNT matches that of TOC2, 
the flag OC2F in the register TFLG1 is set and a specified action is 
automatically taken. This action can be to set the OC2 output line (PA6 in this 
case), clear OC2 or toggle OC2. At the same time a Timer Output Compare 2 
interrupt can be generated if the OC2I mask in TMSK1 had been set.</P>
<P>
<H3>Input Capture</H3>
<P>The input capture feature can be used to make time, frequency or period 
measurements. Firstly, an Input Capture register and associated input line is 
chosen, for example, IC3 (which is PA0). Two bits (EDG3A and EDG3B) of Timer 
Control Register 2 (TCTL2) are configured to capture on rising or falling edges 
or both. When the specified edge is detected on IC3, the flag IC3F in the 
register TFLG1 is set and the current content of TCNT is latched into the 16-bit 
Input Capture register TIC3. A Timer Input Capture 3 interrupt is generated if 
the IC3I mask in TMSK1 had been set.</P>

<HR align=center>
Interrupt Latency, Service and Response Time</H3>
<P>Interrupt latency is the time taken from the onset of the interrupting event 
to the start of the interrupt service routine. This includes the time taken for 
the CPU to respond to the interrupt, finish executing the current instruction, 
save the registers on to the stack, and fetch the ISR address from the interrupt 
vector table. The interrupt service time is the time taken by the ISR to service 
the interrupt, that is, the length of time occupied by the ISR. The total 
interrupt response time is the sum of the interrupt latency and the service. 
This is a measure of how rapidly the system responds to interrupts and therefore 
the maximum allowable rate of interrupts.</P>
<P>In order to achieve the fastest response, it is important that all interrupt 
service routines be executed as quickly as possible. Therefore ISR tasks should 
be restricted to simply acknowledging and dismissing the interrupt flag. Any 
involved tasks or calculations should be done outside of the ISR.</P>

      what is absolutely essential before rushing to the hospital. The time 
      spent providing essential care and transportation to the hospital is 8

Timer Interrupt Example</H3>
<P><A href="http://www.physics.mcmaster.ca/phy4d6/Lab/Source/example5.txt" 
target=_blank>Example 5</A> demonstrates how to set up a Timer Output Compare 
ISR.</P>
<P>There are four steps required to setup the program to respond to timer 
interrupts.</P>
<OL>
  <LI>Set up the required timer function. 
  <LI>Provide the required ISR to handle and dismiss the interrupt. 
  <LI>Set the address of the ISR in the interrupt vector table. 
  <LI>Enable interrupts. </LI></OL>
<P>In this example, an Output Compare function is used to create a timebase of 
100ms, that is, the MCU will be interrupted 10 times each second. The program 
begins by setting up the stack pointer and setting the prescaler for 
divide-by-4. Interrupt from OC1 is unmasked and the interrupt mask flag in the 
CCR is cleared by the CLI instruction.</P>
<P>The address of the ISR declared as <B><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica">toc1isr</FONT></B> is automatically written into the 
interrupt vector table by the assembler and loader by the assembler directive 
<B><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica">FDB toc1isr</FONT></B> at location $FFE8. Thus 
when an OC1 interrupt is generated, the CPU fetches the address of the ISR from 
the appropriate interrupt vector location and copies it to the PC. This causes 
execution to be transferred to the ISR.</P>
<P>In the ISR the OC1 register is incremented by 50,000 in preparation for the 
next output compare. The interrupting flag is cleared and a software flag is set 
which will be sensed by the main program. In this example, the E clock has a 
period of 0.5 µs. Since the prescaler has been set for divide-by-4, the timer 
register TCNT is incremented every 2 µs. A match with the OC1 register will 
occur every 2 × 50,000 = 100,000 µs.</P>
<P>Note that both the TCNT and OC1 registers will eventually overflow since the 
maximum count is 65535. This does not affect the operation of this example. The 
value 50,000 is added to the contents of the OC1 register using MOD 65536 
arithmetic.
