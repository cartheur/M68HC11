## Technical details

MC68HC11A1P Product details
Introduction
The MC68HC11A8, MC68HC11A1, and MC68HC11A0 high-performance microcontroller units (MCUs) are based on the M68HC11 Family. These high speed, low power consumption chips have multiplexed buses and a fully static design. The chips can operate at frequencies from 3 MHz to dc. The three MCUs are created from the same masks; the only differences are the value stored in the CONFIG register, and whether or not the ROM or EEPROM is tested and guaranteed.

## The _current_ state

Pretty messy as it is a file-dump from June 2003, when I purchased a pair from eBay 14.06.2003. Here is what the collection looks like
